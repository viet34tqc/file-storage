# Online file storage

## Techstack

- Framework: NextJs
- Authentication: Clerk. Alternatively, you can use 'next-auth'. I'm using it because it works well with Convex
- Backennd service: Convex. This is all-in-one backend service: database, file storages. TODO: replace this with a self-hosted backend.
- Styling: Tailwind and shadcn ui
